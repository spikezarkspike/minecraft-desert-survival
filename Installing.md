# Installing the minecraft-desert-survival datapacks

Please Note: At the present time, Datapacks require a snapshot version of Minecraft, a pre-release 1.13 version. They will not work on version 1.12 or lower. 


Download either the current source tree in datapacks-source, or one of the zip files in datapacks-versions. (At the time of writing, deploying a zip file directly does not appear to work, so you will have to unpack the zip file or extract it into the datapacks folder.) 

In either case the contents consists of a structure similar to:

spikezarkspike_the_bone_age/

the_bone_age_easier   the_bone_age_hard    the_bone_age_hardest

the_bone_age_easiest  the_bone_age_harder  the_bone_age_no_planks

* Ensure you have a snapshot of Minecraft loaded.
* Create a NEW world (unpredictable effects occur with existing worlds).
* Save and Quit to Title to persist this new world to disk.
* Verify there is a datapacks directory under this new world in your saves folder.
* (The world saves are found under the saves folder under .minecraft in your home directory, for unix. For Windows... not sure.) 
* Copy one of the datapacks into the datapacks folder. 
* For example, if you want to play with the_bone_age_hardest, copy that folder into the datapacks folder of your new world, so that it appears as a subfolder of the datapacks folder. 
* It is possible to install multiple datapacks into the folder, but by default all of them will be enabled, which will give the effect of the easiest setting, or even easier. If you are comfortable with the 'datapack disable' and 'datapack enable' commands in Minecraft, by all means install multiple datapacks.
