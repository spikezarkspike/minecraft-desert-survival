# Installing the minecraft-desert-survival datapacks

PleaseNote: At the present time, Datapacks require a snapshot version of Minecraft, a pre-release 1.13 version. They will not work on version 1.12 or lower. 


Download either the current source tree in datapacks-source, or one of the
zip files in datapacks-versions. In either case this consists of a structure similar to:

spikezarkspike_the_bone_age/

the_bone_age_easier   the_bone_age_hard    the_bone_age_hardest

the_bone_age_easiest  the_bone_age_harder  the_bone_age_no_planks

* Ensure you have a snapshot of Minecraft loaded.
* Create a NEW world (unpredictable effects occur with existing worlds).
* Save and Quit to Title to persist this new world to disk.
* Verify there is a datapacks directory under this new world in your saves folder.
* (The world saves are found under the saves folder under .minecraft in your home directory, for unix. For Windows... not sure.) 
* Copy one of the datapacks into the datapacks folder. 
* For example, if you want to play with the_bone_age_hardest, copy that folder into the datapacks folder of your new world, so that it appears as a subfolder of the datapacks folder.
