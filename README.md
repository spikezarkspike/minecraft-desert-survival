Datapacks to make it slightly more feasible to survive in Minecraft in an Endless Desert

Relates to the Tutorial, Survival in an Infinite Desert, on the Minecraft Official Wiki at

https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Survival_in_an_infinite_desert

This repo contains a set of datapacks, of graduated difficulty, that reduce the challenge of desert survival. These are not cheats as such, because desert survival, or at least, advancement, depending on the scenario, can be completely impossible. These datapacks primary intent is not to make it easy to survive, but to make it possible. 

The major problems in Minecraft desert survival are unavailability of a 3x3 Crafting Table and unavailability of wooden tools to start the tech tree. The single critical problem is unavailability of Wooden Planks. For more details, see the Tutorial. 

The datapacks take one or more of the following approaches:

* allow crafting of a Crafting Table from materials available in the desert
* allow crafting of bone tools and weapons, equivalent to wooden tools and weapons
* allow crafting of substitute 'wood' planks from materials available in the desert, eg. bone or bonemeal blocks.
* allow additional 2x2 crafting (in the Inventory screen)

(to be done)
* allow recovery of wooden raw materials from the destruction of found wooden objects
